## \[\* KaZaA AdCache Remover \*\]


</div>

### Description

This program deletes all the entries in your AdCache folder(usually C:\Windows\AdCache) every second. In other words, this removes 90% of the pop up ads the occur in KaZaA Media Desktop. If you use KaZaA this program is really helpful. This program was one of my first programs I made, so give me a little slack in the coding! Even though some of the coding is pretty screwed up, the program works and it removes most of the ads in KaZaA.
 
### More Info
 
Note: This program may hang occansionally and you may need to redirect the AdCache folder. (Default: C:\Windows\AdCache)
